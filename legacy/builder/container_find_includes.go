Include detection

This code is responsible for figuring out what libraries the current
sketch needs an populates both Context.ImportedLibraries with a list of
Library objects, and Context.IncludeFolders with a list of folders to
put on the include path.

Simply put, every #include in a source file pulls in the library that
provides that source file. This includes source files in the selected
libraries, so libraries can recursively include other libraries as well.

To implement this, the gcc preprocessor is used. A queue is created
containing, at first, the source files in the sketch. Each of the files
in the queue is processed in turn by running the preprocessor on it. If
the preprocessor provides an error, the output is examined to see if the
error is a missing header file originating from a #include directive.

The filename is extracted from that #include directive, and a library is
found that provides it. If multiple libraries provide the same file, one
is slected (how this selection works is not described here, see the
ResolveLibrary function for that). The library selected in this way is
added to the include path through Context.IncludeFolders and the list of
libraries to include in the link through Context.ImportedLibraries.

Furthermore, all of the library source files are added to the queue, to
be processed as well. When the preprocessor completes without showing an
#include error, processing of the file is complete and it advances to
the next. When no library can be found for a included filename, an error
is shown and the process is aborted.

Caching

Since this process is fairly slow (requiring at least one invocation of
the preprocessor per source file), its results are cached.

Just caching the complete result (i.e. the resulting list of imported
libraries) seems obvious, but such a cache is hard to invalidate. Making
a list of all the source and header files used to create the list and
check if any of them changed is probably feasible, but this would also
require caching the full list of libraries to invalidate the cache when
the include to library resolution might have a different result. Another
downside of a complete cache is that any changes requires re-running
everything, even if no includes were actually changed.

Instead, caching happens by keeping a sort of "journal" of the steps in
the include detection, essentially tracing each file processed and each
include path entry added. The cache is used by retracing these steps:
The include detection process is executed normally, except that instead
of running the preprocessor, the include filenames are (when possible)
read from the cache. Then, the include file to library resolution is
again executed normally. The results are checked against the cache and
as long as the results match, the cache is considered valid.

When a source file (or any of the files it includes, as indicated by the
.d file) is changed, the preprocessor is executed as normal for the
file, ignoring any includes from the cache. This does not, however,
invalidate the cache: If the results from the preprocessor match the
entries in the cache, the cache remains valid and can again be used for
the next (unchanged) file.

The cache file uses the JSON format and contains a list of entries. Each
entry represents a discovered library and contains:
 - Sourcefile: The source file that the include was found in
 - Include: The included filename found
 - Includepath: The addition to the include path

There are also some special entries:
 - When adding the initial include path entries, such as for the core
   and variant paths.  These are not discovered, so the Sourcefile and
   Include fields will be empty.
 - When a file contains no (more) missing includes, an entry with an
   empty Include and IncludePath is generated.
